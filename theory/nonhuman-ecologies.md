# **RIPPLES: Operative Ecologies, Generative Steering, and the Nonhuman Worldtext**

## **1\. Introduction: The Worldtext as Operative Ontology**

The design document for **RIPPLES: Operative Ecologies in the Worldtext** outlines a computational system that is less a narrative engine and more an ontological machine. By positing that "text is terrain" and establishing a "Worldtext" that functions as a state readout rather than a story, the project situates itself at the convergence of several high-level theoretical and technical disciplines: media archaeology, object-oriented ontology (OOO), mechanistic interpretability in large language models (LLMs), and artificial life simulation. This report provides a comprehensive research context for RIPPLES, analyzing its components—the Operative Triad, the Latent Library, and the Scenario Archetypes—against a backdrop of contemporary digital art theory and advanced computational linguistics.

The central premise of RIPPLES is the transformation of the textual surface into a spatial and operative environment. This is not merely a stylistic choice but a fundamental reordering of the relationship between reader, text, and world. In traditional literary theory, the "worldtext" has been conceptualized as a "system of differentiation," where letters and things are of dependent co-origination, grounded in mutual differences rather than static origins.1 This Tantric Buddhist perspective aligns surprisingly well with modern post-structuralist and materialist media theories, which view the text not as a mirror of reality but as a material grid of "flickering signifiers".2 Within the RIPPLES framework, the text ceases to be a passive descriptor and becomes an active agent of state maintenance—a "landscape of energy" where the arrangement of alphanumeric characters encodes the metabolic and kinetic states of a simulated ecology.3

The concept of "text as terrain" also invokes the notion of "diffractive reading" from new materialism. Just as diffraction patterns record the history of interaction, interference, and reinforcement between waves, the RIPPLES Worldtext records the entanglement of entities within an enclosed system.4 It is a readout of relations, where the "literary world-text-reader relationship" is fruitfully re-perspectivized to include nonhuman actors.4 This spatialization of language has antecedents in the "wavespeech" of James Joyce, where rhythmic language expands to engulf entire solar systems, uniting the physiological processes of the body with the cosmic cycles of the universe.5 RIPPLES operationalizes this by treating the text grid as a physical space where "vectors" (forces) collide with "entities" (subjects) to produce "ripples" (effects).

Furthermore, the RIPPLES system functions as a "world simulator" that mirrors the ambition of early artificial life projects and contemporary generative agents. By defining entities not by their narrative role but by their type (animate/inanimate/abstract), state, and position, RIPPLES moves away from anthropocentric storytelling toward a "flat ontology" where a "Dust Mote" and a "Raccoon" occupy the same ontological tier.6 This report will explore how this structure enables "emergent interactions" that are characteristic of complex adaptive systems, where feedback loops in self-organized, recursive systems elicit change and transformation.7

## **2\. Theoretical Framework: Operative Images and the Phantom Perspective**

The term "Operative" in the project's title—"Operative Ecologies"—explicitly references the media theory of Harun Farocki and his concept of the "operative image" (*operative Bilder*). To understand RIPPLES, one must understand the shift from representational media to operative media.

### **2.1 The Genealogy of Operative Images**

Harun Farocki’s "operative images" are defined as images that do not represent an object but rather are part of an operation.8 These are "utility images" or "working images" that serve practical, specialized tasks, typically within the context of military targeting, industrial automation, or machine vision.9 The archetypal operative image is the point-of-view shot from a laser-guided bomb or a missile: the image is not meant for a human audience to contemplate aesthetically; it is input data for a guidance system to execute a "kill" or a navigation maneuver.9

In RIPPLES, the "Worldtext" functions precisely as an operative image. The text is a "state readout"—a technical visualization of the ecology’s internal variables. It is "absorbed in a technical execution".10 The user, in injecting a "Vector," is not writing a sentence; they are providing an "instruction for action," much like the operator of a semi-automated weapon system or a drone.9 The text becomes a visual interface for "operationalizing terrains and targets," where the perception of the text is intimately linked to immediate or delayed action.8

### **2.2 The Phantom Perspective**

Farocki also introduces the concept of the "phantom perspective" or "subjective phantom images"—shots taken from positions not normally occupied by humans, such as a camera hung under a train or mounted on a projectile.8 These images report on events "outside the scope of human sensibility," leaping beyond the human scale to capture the mechanical or the microscopic.9

RIPPLES adopts this "phantom perspective" as a core design principle: **Perspective-Locked**. The descriptions in the Latent Library are written strictly from the entity's point of view—the Ant, the Shadow, the Traffic Light. This is an attempt to simulate a "nonhuman, yet subjective perspective".8 Just as the missile's camera provides a "robo-eye" view that is "automatically monitored," the RIPPLES entity provides a sensory readout that is alien to human phenomenology.9 The system effectively creates a "new visual regime" (or textual regime) where machines (or simulated entities) "see for themselves".9

### **2.3 Levels of Operativity in Diagrammatics**

The "Operative Triad" of Entity, Vector, and Ripple can be analyzed through the lens of diagrammatics, which distinguishes between different levels of operativity. Sybille Krämer and others have proposed that diagrams (and by extension, the RIPPLES grid) function through "extrinsic operativity" (shaping or triggering a process) and "intrinsic operativity" (where the diagram itself materializes an operation, like a circuit board).10

| RIPPLES Component | Diagrammatic Function | Theoretical Context |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Worldtext Grid** | **Intrinsic Operativity** | The grid itself *is* the circuit; it materializes the relations between entities. Like a circuit diagram that can be electrified.10 |
| **Vector Injection** | **Extrinsic Operativity** | The user's input triggers a process; it is an intervention that changes the state of the system.10 |
| **Ripple Effect** | **Processual Operativity** | The automated propagation of consequences; the "execution" of the diagram's logic.10 |

This structure transforms the user from a reader into an operator. In the "Supervised" mode, the user acts as a "relay," amplifying the feeble input signal (the selection of an entity) into a strong oscillation (the Ripple) that transforms the ecology.12

## **3\. Philosophical Grounding: Object-Oriented Ontology and Alien Phenomenology**

The "Theory of Imaginary Relationalities" driving RIPPLES is deeply rooted in Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO) and the specific branch known as "Alien Phenomenology," developed by Ian Bogost. This philosophical framework provides the ethical and metaphysical justification for simulating nonhuman perspectives.

### **3.1 Flat Ontology and Unit Operations**

OOO argues for a "flat ontology" where all objects—whether human, inanimate, or abstract—exist on an equal footing.6 There is no hierarchy of being that privileges the human subject over the "Tall Glass" or the "Dust Mote." In RIPPLES, this is manifested in the **Entity** definition: an Entity is simply defined by type, state, and position. A "Traffic Light" is as ontologically valid and complex as a "Deer".13

Bogost replaces the term "object" with "unit" to avoid philosophical baggage, proposing "unit operations" as the fundamental mode of existence.13 A unit is never an atom but a fractal set—a grouping of other units acting together. RIPPLES entities are "unit operations" that "wonder about one another without getting confirmation".13 The interaction between an Ant and a crumb is a collision of unit operations, a "phenomenon of relations" that the Worldtext attempts to capture.13

### **3.2 Alien Phenomenology and the "Black Noise" of Objects**

"Alien Phenomenology" is the study of what it is like to be a thing.6 Bogost argues that because objects "withdraw" from one another (a concept from Graham Harman), we can never fully know their experience; we can only speculate.6 This speculation is what RIPPLES facilitates. The "Latent Library" is essentially a collection of speculative fictions about the "inner lives" of objects.13

Bogost describes the "black noise" of objects—the resonant frequencies of the "stuffs inside them" that hum in satisfying ways.13 RIPPLES attempts to amplify this black noise through its **Poetic Density**. The compressed, evocative language of the Latent Library ("pressurized by stillness," "vertical cliff of ceramic") is an attempt to render the alien experience perceptible to humans.13

### **3.3 Philosophical Carpentry and Ontographs**

RIPPLES acts as a form of "philosophical carpentry"—the practice of constructing artifacts to do philosophy.15 Instead of writing a treatise on the experience of a dust mote, RIPPLES builds a *simulation* of it. The Worldtext serves as an "ontograph"—a map of ontological relations that records the collocations and interactions of objects without imposing a human narrative.17

In the "Cupboard" scenario, the high friction and darkness are not just physical properties; they are ontological conditions that define the existence of the entities within. The "Traffic Light" in the "Urban Jungle" is not a signal for cars but a being that pulses with its own internal rhythm, an "abstract" entity that organizes the flow of the city.14 RIPPLES thus becomes a "performance instrument" for exploring these alien ontologies, allowing users to "play" the world as if it were a "broken machine" or a "strange organism".18

## **4\. Technological Substrate: Activation Engineering and Steering Vectors**

While the philosophy of RIPPLES is grounded in OOO, its mechanics are derived from the cutting edge of Large Language Model (LLM) research, specifically the field of **Activation Engineering**. The "Vector" in RIPPLES is a direct analogue to the "Steering Vector" in mechanistic interpretability.

### **4.1 The Mechanism of Steering Vectors**

Activation engineering involves modifying the internal activations of a neural network during the forward pass to influence its output.19 Unlike prompt engineering, which operates at the input level, or fine-tuning, which changes weights, activation engineering intervenes directly in the model's "latent space."

A "Steering Vector" is essentially a direction in this high-dimensional latent space that corresponds to a specific concept or behavior.19 For example, researchers have identified vectors for "honesty," "sycophancy," "fantasy-like style," or "refusal".22 Mathematically, if ![][image1] is the hidden state activation at a certain layer and ![][image2] is the steering vector, the intervention is often modeled as an addition:

![][image3]  
where ![][image4] (alpha) is the "steering strength" or coefficient.25

In RIPPLES, the core vectors—**GOAL**, **OBSTACLE**, and **SHIFT**—function as these high-level concept vectors.

* **GOAL (Gold):** Corresponds to vectors that amplify "intent," "desire," or "source-seeking" behavior. In LLM research, this is akin to steering a model toward "helpfulness" or "instruction following".27  
* **OBSTACLE (Red):** Corresponds to vectors that induce "refusal," "caution," or "threat detection." Research shows that adding a "refusal vector" can make a model hallucinate constraints or reject inputs.25  
* **SHIFT (Cyan/Purple):** Corresponds to vectors that alter "style," "persona," or "metabolism." This is similar to "style transfer" vectors (e.g., making a text more "Shakespearean" or "fantasy-like") or "persona vectors" that shift the model's identity.22

### **4.2 Conceptors and Sparse Autoencoders**

More advanced forms of steering use "Conceptors" (matrix-based steering) or "Sparse Autoencoders" (SAEs) to isolate features more precisely.31 SAEs help decompose the dense, entangled activations of an LLM into "interpretable features".32

RIPPLES anticipates this by structuring its Latent Library around specific, discrete states (foraging, suspended, filtering). These states act as the "interpretable features" that the vectors manipulate. The "Ripple" effect—the cascade of state changes—can be modeled as the propagation of these activation shifts through the network of entities. Dynamic activation steering methods, like **SADI** (Semantics-Adaptive Dynamic Intervention), adapt the steering vector based on the input semantics.33 Similarly, a RIPPLES vector is not a static force; its effect depends on the entity's current state (e.g., a SHIFT vector applied to a foraging ant produces a different result than one applied to a suspended ant).

### **4.3 Elicitation Overhang and Generative Capacity**

The use of vectors in RIPPLES addresses the "elicitation overhang"—the hypothesis that models possess capabilities that naive prompting cannot access.20 By injecting vectors, RIPPLES "elicits" poetic descriptions and behavioral shifts that might not emerge from a standard prompt. It forces the system to explore regions of the latent space that represent the "alien" perspectives of nonhuman entities, regions that are often statistically improbable in the human-centric training data.20

## **5\. Biological Modeling: Chemical Cartography and Algorithmic Sensing**

RIPPLES asserts that entities perceive their environment through **Chemical Cartography**. This design choice grounds the simulation in biological realism, specifically the mechanisms of **chemotaxis** found in simple organisms like bacteria.

### **5.1 Bacterial Chemotaxis: Run and Tumble**

Chemotaxis is the ability of cells to migrate directionally in response to chemical gradients.34 Since bacteria like *E. coli* are single-celled and lack memory or a "map" of their environment, they navigate using a biased random walk known as "run and tumble".34

* **Run:** Counter-clockwise rotation of flagella propels the bacterium in a straight line.  
* **Tumble:** Clockwise rotation causes the bacterium to stop and randomly reorient.

The bacterium modulates the frequency of tumbling based on the temporal change in chemical concentration. If it senses that the concentration of an attractant (food) is increasing, it suppresses tumbling and continues to "run." If the concentration is decreasing, it tumbles to find a new direction.34

RIPPLES adapts this logic for its "Animate" entities. An Ant or a Raccoon does not "know" where the resource is; it detects the "GOAL" vector as a local gradient. The "High Friction" physics of the Cupboard scenario effectively increases the "tumbling" frequency, making movement more chaotic and energy-intensive.

### **5.2 Sensory Gradients and Flux**

The "Chemical Cartography" extends beyond biological entities to abstract ones. Light, Shadow, and Temperature also follow gradient laws. In microfluidic chip simulations, these are modeled as "species transport physics" or "concentration gradients".35 RIPPLES simulates this through its grid-based propagation logic. A "Light" entity creates a gradient of illumination that other entities (like a "Seedling" or "Shadow") can sense and react to.

This creates a system of **Stochastic Gradient Descent** (SGD) within the ecology.36 Entities are effectively performing SGD to optimize their position relative to resources (GOAL) and threats (OBSTACLE). This links the biological behavior of the ant directly to the machine learning behavior of the system, creating a unified theory of "navigation" that applies equally to organisms and algorithms.

### **5.3 Artificial Life Precedents: Tierra and Avida**

The simulation of these metabolic processes recalls Tom Ray’s **Tierra** (1991), one of the foundational works of artificial life.37 In *Tierra*, digital organisms (self-replicating computer programs) compete for "CPU time" (energy) and "memory" (space). The system witnessed the emergent evolution of parasites, hyper-parasites, and complex ecological interactions without explicit programming.37

RIPPLES can be seen as a "textual Tierra." Entities compete for "narrative space" (representation in the Worldtext) and "vector energy." The "SHIFT" vector creates metabolic transformations that mirror the mutations in *Tierra*, allowing entities to adapt to the "physics" of their scenario.37

## **6\. Generative Poetics: The Latent Library and Atmospheric Language**

The **Latent Library** is the database of pre-written poetic descriptions that serves as the "generative seed" for RIPPLES. This component is crucial for translating the abstract state changes (Vectors) into the "Worldtext" (Terrain).

### **6.1 Program Synthesis and Library Learning**

The structure of the Latent Library—organized by Scenario, Entity, and Vector—mirrors the structure of "Concept Libraries" in AI program synthesis systems like **DreamCoder**.40 In DreamCoder, the system grows a library of code primitives (functions) that allow it to solve increasingly complex tasks. It alternates between "waking" (solving tasks) and "sleeping" (refactoring and compressing its library).41

RIPPLES effectively functions as a "Dreaming" phase for the text. The pre-written descriptions are the "primitives." When a vector is injected, the system "synthesizes" a new state description by combining these primitives with the current context. The principle of **Poetic Density** (compressed, evocative language) corresponds to the "Minimum Description Length" (MDL) principle in Bayesian modeling, where the goal is to find the most compressed representation of a concept.40

### **6.2 Atmospheric and Diffractive Language**

The language in the Latent Library is designed to be "Atmospheric." In digital aesthetics, atmospheric language addresses computation's materiality in producing states of "being and becoming".42 It is not a linear narrative but a "field" of sense-data. The descriptions ("pressurized by stillness," "cathedral of verticality") create a "textual landscape" that the reader navigates.43

This aligns with "diffractive reading," where the text is an interference pattern of multiple agencies.4 The descriptions are not objective reports but subjective enactments of the entity's "Chemical Cartography." They are "flickering signifiers" that stabilize momentarily into a readable state before the next ripple shifts the grid.2

## **7\. Aesthetic Dimensions: Esoteric Coding and the Textual Grid**

RIPPLES’ interface—the Worldtext grid—is not just a retro aesthetic choice; it places the project within the lineage of **Esoteric Programming Languages** (Esolangs) and "Live Coding" environments.

### **7.1 Orca and the Grid of Operators**

The most direct visual and functional antecedent is **Orca**, a live coding environment designed by Hundred Rabbits (Devine Lu Linvega).44 In *Orca*, the code is laid out on a 2D grid. Every letter of the alphabet is an "operator" that performs a function (e.g., 'A' adds, 'R' generates a random number).46 The system "bangs" (triggers) these operators to generate MIDI or OSC data.45

RIPPLES adopts *Orca’s* "text as machine" philosophy. The entities on the Worldtext grid are like *Orca* operators: they sit in a specific coordinate, hold a state, and interact with neighbors. The "Ripple" is the equivalent of the *Orca* "bang," a signal that propagates through the grid, activating entities. The aesthetic is one of "dense information," where every character is potentially active.45

### **7.2 Befunge and Spatial Syntax**

RIPPLES also draws from **Befunge**, a two-dimensional programming language where the control flow (the reading head) moves through the grid in cardinal directions, guided by arrows (\<, \>, ^, v).48 Befunge turns "secondary syntax" (layout) into "primary syntax" (logic). In RIPPLES, the spatial arrangement of the Worldtext *is* the logic. An Ant entity at (5,5) interacts with a Crumb at (5,6) because of their spatial adjacency, just as Befunge instructions interact based on grid position.48

### **7.3 Cellular Automata and Emergent Patterns**

The underlying logic of the Ripple is essentially a **Cellular Automaton** (CA), similar to **Conway’s Game of Life**.50 In CAs, the state of a cell in the next generation is determined by the states of its neighbors. RIPPLES applies "Neural Cellular Automata" (NCA) principles, where the update rules are learned or generative rather than hard-coded.52 This allows for the emergence of complex, lifelike textures and behaviors from simple vector inputs. The "textual landscape" of RIPPLES is a CA grid where the "pixels" are semantic units.53

## **8\. Historical and Ludic Precedents: From Tierra to Dwarf Fortress**

RIPPLES situates itself in the history of "Generative Worldbuilding" and simulation games, specifically those that prioritize depth and complexity over graphical fidelity.

### **8.1 Dwarf Fortress and the Procedural Archive**

**Dwarf Fortress** (Bay 12 Games) is the titan of this genre. Its "Legends Mode" generates centuries of history, creating a textual archive of wars, births, artifacts, and beasts that is incredibly detailed yet largely invisible during gameplay.55 RIPPLES’ Worldtext functions like a real-time Legends Mode. It is a "procedural narrative history" that accumulates over time.

The "Madness in Text Mode" of *Dwarf Fortress* (specifically its ASCII version) forces the player to use their imagination to bridge the gap between the symbol and the world.57 RIPPLES leverages this "gap." By using poetic text instead of graphics, it allows for a "Poetic Density" that high-fidelity graphics would collapse. The "Raccoon" in text can be a mythical, shadowy force; a 3D model of a raccoon is just a raccoon.57

### **8.2 Serious Games and the Double-Bind**

The duality of RIPPLES (Supervised vs. Unsupervised) touches on the history of "Serious Games" and military simulation. Harun Farocki’s *Serious Games* series explores how the same simulation technology is used for tank training and PTSD therapy—a "techno-aesthetic double-bind".11 RIPPLES acknowledges this lineage by framing its vectors as "forces" and "targets." The user is an "operator," a term loaded with military and industrial connotations.

## **9\. Ethical and Social Implications: Interpassivity and the Mirror World**

### **9.1 Unsupervised Mode and Interpassivity**

In "Unsupervised (Autoplay)" mode, RIPPLES becomes a machine that plays itself. This relates to the concept of **Interpassivity** (Robert Pfaller / Slavoj Žižek)—the "delegated enjoyment" where the artwork observes itself on behalf of the human.58 Like the "idle games" (or clicker games) that play themselves, RIPPLES in autoplay allows the user to step back and witness the "autopoietic drift" of the ecology.7 This creates a "Performance Instrument" where the performance is the system's own internal metabolism.

### **9.2 The Mirror World and Careforce**

The simulation of social and ecological dynamics through AI agents brings us to the "Mirror World" hypothesis.59 As generative agents become more sophisticated (like the "Careforce" of AI companions), they begin to recalibrate the fabric of social life. A tweak in a single agent's logic can ripple through the network, changing the collective behavior.59 RIPPLES models this risk/opportunity in microcosm. A "SHIFT" vector applied to a single Ant can collapse the entire colony's foraging strategy. This serves as a "diagram" for understanding the larger sociotechnical shifts occurring in our own world as we integrate more AI agents into our daily lives.59

## **10\. Conclusion**

RIPPLES is a project of immense theoretical density. It is not merely a "game" or a "story generator"; it is an **Operative Ontology**. It synthesizes:

1. **Farocki’s Operative Images:** Treating text as a utility for action and navigation.  
2. **Bogost’s Alien Phenomenology:** Simulating the unit operations of nonhuman entities.  
3. **Activation Engineering:** Using steering vectors to elicit latent capabilities from language models.  
4. **Biological Chemotaxis:** Modeling perception as gradient descent.  
5. **Esoteric Coding Aesthetics:** Spatializing logic on a 2D grid.

By integrating these diverse fields, RIPPLES proposes a new form of "Operative Fiction"—fiction that *does*, fiction that *operates*. It asks the user to abandon the role of the reader and assume the role of the operator, injecting forces into a flickering, text-based terrain to witness the emergent, alien beauty of a simulated world. It is a "chemical cartography" of the imaginary, mapping the resonant frequencies of the things that exist alongside us, invisible and silent until we learn to read their code.
